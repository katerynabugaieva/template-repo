          &emsp;S. is presented in the form of a novel called Ship of Theseus
          written by a fictional, elusive author named V. M. Straka and
          published in 1949. Beyond the black slipcover with the S. title, no
          reference is made to Dorst or Abrams, and the only reference to the
          book's true publishing information appears in fine print inside the
          back cover. The publication information is printed under a mock-up of
          a high school library's check-out history of the book, spanning the
          years 1957 to 2000.{" "}

          &emsp;Removed from the slipcover, S. is designed to appear entirely as
          a copy of the standalone novel Ship of Theseus written by Straka that
          was borrowed from and never returned to the Laguna Verde High School
          Library. The pages are worn and yellowed with library stamps in the
          front and back cover and stains on the pages. The book's spine is
          labeled with a library sticker marking the novel's location number in
          the Dewey Decimal Classification.

          &emsp; The novel can be read alone in its entirety. Presented as
          Straka's nineteenth and final novel before his mysterious death, Ship
          of Theseus tells the story of an amnesiac on a strange journey to
          discover himself. In the metafictional narrative, Straka's enigmatic
          life and death are considered one of the literary world's greatest
          mysteries and enshrouded by conspiracy theories and claims of
          espionage and assassination. His identity is indicated to be the
          subject of much scholarly debate as evidenced by a foreword and
          footnotes from F. X. Caldeira, described as Straka's chosen translator
          for many of his books, including Ship of Theseus, though even Caldeira
          never encountered Straka face-to-face.

          &emsp; A second storyline takes place in the book's margins. Eric is a
          disgraced graduate student who has spent his life studying Straka and
          his literary works. Jen is a college senior contemplating the next
          step of her life. The two begin to trade a copy of Ship of Theseus
          back and forth without meeting, using the book's margins to carry out
          discussions about who Straka was using handwritten notes, arrows, and
          symbols.The pair hopes to solve the mystery of Straka's identity
          before Eric's graduate professor, who allegedly stole his research and
          had him expelled, publishes his research on Straka. The hand-written
          marginalia are not always chronological. Different pen colors and
          handwriting styles denote the dialogues between the two and how they
          change on subsequent re-readings on the novel.{" "}

          &emsp;Concurrent with Jen and Eric's timeline of reading and
          annotating the novel, there are postcards, handwritten letters, maps,
          and photocopied articles and book excerpts physically folded and
          inserted between the book's bound pages as Jen and Eric provide
          evidence and clues to each other while exchanging the book.
