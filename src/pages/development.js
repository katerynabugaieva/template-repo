        S. is a collaboration between film producer J. J. Abrams, who came up
        with the concept for the book, and writer Doug Dorst. Abrams stated that
        the idea came from finding a book on a bench that had an inscription:
        "to whomever finds this book please read it and take it somewhere and
        leave it for someone else to read." Dorst has stated that his idea
        for the central concept of the story was inspired by two literary
        mysteries: the Shakespeare authorship question and the controversy over
        the identity of B. Traven, who wrote several acclaimed and successful
        novels in the early 20th century but so closely guarded his privacy that
        his true identity has never been conclusively established. He wrote
        Ship of Theseus first, intending it to be read on its own merits. The
        marginal notes and ephemera were added later. </p>
        <p>&emsp; The authors intended the
        book as a physical object, and not just a story. Abrams noted that "to
        physically hold it is kind of the point." One reviewer called S. an
        argument for paying extra for a physical book, "a possessor of wonders
        that cannot be translated into digital bits." Abrams' film production
        company, Bad Robot Productions, released a trailer online entitled
        "Stranger", leading to rumors that it could to be Abrams' next film or
        TV project, perhaps even a spin-off to the TV series Lost. It was
        finally explained to be promoting S., after an official trailer for the
        book was released.
