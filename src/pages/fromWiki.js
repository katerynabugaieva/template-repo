          &emsp;S. is a 2013 novel written by Doug Dorst and conceived by J. J.
          Abrams. The novel is unusual in its format, presented as a story
          within a story. It is composed of the novel Ship of Theseus by a
          fictional author, and hand-written notes filling the book's margins as
          a dialogue between two college students hoping to uncover the author's
          mysterious identity and the novel's secret plus loose supplementary
          materials tucked in between pages.
